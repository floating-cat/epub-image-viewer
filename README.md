# EPUB Iamges Viewer

A project also named Light Novel Ebook Illustrations Viewer.

When I buy a newer eBook for a light novel series, I want to revisit the preceding illustrations in that series. Because sometimes the last book I read in this series is long before, and I need to wake up
my love for the characters in this series.

Also when I read the light novels in my eBook reader, I want to view the big/colorful illustrations in other screens.

That's why this project was born.
